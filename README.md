# Real-Estate-Price-Predictor
In this project I had analyzed the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook, looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, dealing with missing values and much more. At the end we present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices on a given set of features.
